# Network Adpaters

Here you can find any kind of networks built on top of n2n-overlay-wrtc and neighborhood-wrtc

If you want to create your own network. Refer to these modules:
* n2n-overlay-wrtc https://github.com/RAN3D/n2n-overlay-wrtc
* neighborhood-wrtc https://github.com/RAN3D/neighborhood-wrtc

All networks built here respect the Abstract Adapter (abstract-adapter.js) API.

Hope you will do the same !
